## Important concepts

- Repository: directory which is going to be tracked by git for changes.

  - local: directory in your computer

  - remote: directory in other location. E.g., github server.

- Commit: changes done in the directory being tracked should be sent to the hosting server
to have it stored in the remote location. The process of sending these changes is called
a commit.

- Branch: git uses a tree-like structure. Branching is an advance concept allowing a user
to develop different features without colliding with each other.

- Merge: changes to files are merged between previous and new versions of each of the files
that are being changed. Most of the times, this is automatically handled by git, unless
something is not clear and human intervention is needed (very common in a repository with
more than one developer).
